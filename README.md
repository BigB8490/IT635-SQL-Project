# IT635-SQL-Project
# Here is my SQL Project for IT635. It includes a small database containing frequently used GYM equipment, which can be useful for determining what type of gym equipment to buy, the rough cost, and the best locations to buy them.

# NOTE: I was only able to connect to the database as user 'equipment' by editing the pg_hba.conf located in /etc/postgresql/12/main. I also uploaded my personal config file as well, but both postgres user and equipment user can access the database and query it.
